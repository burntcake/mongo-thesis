# Time-to-durability

Plotting graphs for comparing different execution histories.

  * `plot.py` takes two execution histories as commandline arguments and plots the latency distributions of write operations.
  * `cdf.py` plots the cumulative distribution of write latencies for two execution histories.
  * `diff.py` plots the difference between the cumulative distributions.
