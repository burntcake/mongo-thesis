@article{bit-preservation,
abstract = {For years, discussions of digital preservation have routinely featured comments such as “bit preservation is a solved problem; the real issues are ...”. Indeed, current digital storage technologies are not just astoundingly cheap and capacious, they are astonishingly reliable. Unfortunately, these attributes drive a kind of “Parkinson's Law” of storage, in which demands continually push beyond the capabilities of systems implementable at an affordable price. This paper is in four parts:Claims, reviewing a typical claim of storage system reliability, showing that it provides no useful information for bit preservation purposes.Theory, proposing “bit half-life” as an initial, if inadequate, measure of bit preservation performance, expressing bit preservation requirements in terms of it, and showing that the requirements being placed on bit preservation systems are so onerous that the experiments required to prove that a solution exists are not feasible.Practice, reviewing recent research into how well actual storage systems preserve bits, showing that they fail to meet the requirements by many orders of magnitude.Policy, suggesting ways of dealing with this unfortunate situation.}, author = {Rosenthal, David S.

@article{large-scale-reliability,
abstract = {Reliability and availability are increasingly important in large-scale storage systems built from thousands of indi-vidual storage devices. Large systems must survive the fail-ure of individual components; in systems with thousands of disks, even infrequent failures are likely in some device. We focus on two types of errors: nonrecoverable read er-rors and drive failures. We discuss mechanisms for detect-ing and recovering from such errors, introducing improved techniques for detecting errors in disk reads and fast re-covery from disk failure. We show that simple RAID cannot guarantee sufficient reliability; our analysis examines the tradeoffs among other schemes between system availabil-ity and storage efficiency. Based on our data, we believe that two-way mirroring should be sufficient for most large storage systems. For those that need very high reliabil-ity, we recommend either three-way mirroring or mirroring combined with RAID.},

@article{fast-paxos,
abstract = {The Paxos consensus algorithm of [122] requires two message delays between when the leader proposes a value and when other processes learn that the value has been chosen. Since inventing Paxos, I had thought that this was the optimal message delay. However, sometime in late 2001 I realized that in most systems that use consensus, values aren't picked out of the air by the system itself; instead, they come from clients. When one counts the message from the client, Paxos requires three message delays. This led me to wonder whether consensus in two message delays, including the client's message, was in fact possible. I proved the lower-bound result announced in [143] that an algorithm that can make progress despite f faults and can achieve consensus in two message delays despite e faults requires more than 2e+f processes. The proof of that result led me pretty quickly to the Fast Paxos algorithm described here. Fast Paxos generalizes the classic Paxos consensus algorithm. It can switch between learning in two or three message delays depending on how many processes are working. More precisely, it can achieve learning in two message delays only in the absence of concurrent conflicting proposals, which [153] shows is the best a general algorithm can do.},

@techreport{vertical-paxos,
abstract = {We introduce a class of Paxos algorithms called Vertical Paxos, in which reconfiguration can occur in the middle of reaching agreement on an individual state-machine command. Vertical Paxos algorithms use an auxiliary configuration master that facilitates agreement on reconfiguration. A special case of these algorithms leads to traditional primary-backup protocols. We show how primary-backup systems in current use can be viewed, and shown to be correct, as instances of Vertical Paxos algorithms. This paper came out of much discussion between Malkhi, Zhou, and myself about reconfiguration. Some day, what we did may result in a long paper about state-machine reconfiguration containing these results and others that have not yet been published. The ideas here are related to the original, unpublished version of [151].},
